# VDS-Sample-Configurations--2026

Vault 2026 Data Standard Configuration Samples for Vault Professional/Vault Professional Office.
The sample collection shares 2 configurations with individual scope and compatibility levels:

--- VDS-MFG-Sample --- This configuration sample applies to Vaults based on the default "Manufacturing" behavior configuration. It is also tested in the Vault "PDMC-Sample" environment, which is available for Autodesk Channel Partners. It demonstrates a fully customized approach for all DataSheets, Tabs, and Menu Commands. Additional features like Shortcuts in VDS for CAD or Tools like "Reserve-Numbers" share insights on how to implement extended functionality or additional tools and commands to VDS clients. You can use this sample to learn how to extend a custom configuration with custom Help documentation. The Help content reflects a legacy configuration. I can't afford the time to keep this up to date with the dynamic, evolving customization samples; please review the framework rather than the content in detail.

--- VDS-PDMC-Sample --- This extended configuration sample requires a dedicated Vault behavior configuration called "PDMC-Sample"; it is available to Autodesk Channel Partners only. The configuration includes everything of VDS-20xx-Manufacturing-Sample but targets comprehensive VDS feature additions and Vault API consumption.

The 2026 releases of the sample received significant enhancements, such as context navigation and Inventor Model State support for displaying CAD BOM content; go to the release section for details.

The code base of VDS Utilities merged from a separate solution/repository into the VDS configuration sample.

I created and maintained these configuration samples as an Autodesk employee. However, Autodesk nor I represent that these samples are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid in other environments. Accordingly, those configuration samples are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind, and you use the applications at your own risk.

Please note that the PDMC-Sample configuration represents the "Doable", meaning it collected as much sample code and workflow options as possible. No production environment should get the full overload of this configuration. It is meant to share ideas and implementation approaches as a resource and template.
